          These exercises focus on fundamental SELECT statements, WHERE clauses, and basic data retrieval.

          solution={`SELECT SectorID, SectorName
FROM Sectors;`}
          solutionExplanation="This query selects specific columns from the Sectors table. Using column names instead of * is a best practice as it's more explicit and performs better."

        <Exercise
          title="Exercise 2: Filtering with WHERE"
          description="Find all companies in the 'Technology' sector. Display the company name and stock ticker."
