          <p>
            <strong>Profile:</strong> One of the world's most popular open-source databases, renowned for

            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Massive community, extensive documentation, fast for read-heavy workloads, simple to set up</li>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Less SQL-compliant than PostgreSQL, can struggle with high concurrent writes, dual licensing considerations</li>
          </ul>
        </Subsection>

        <Subsection title="PostgreSQL">
          <p>
            <strong>Profile:</strong> Widely regarded as the most advanced and feature-rich open-source 
            relational database. Known for strict SQL standards adherence, robustness, and powerful extensibility.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Powerful query optimizer, advanced data types (JSONB, PostGIS), excellent concurrency (MVCC), permissive license</li>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Steeper learning curve, slightly more resource-intensive than MySQL</li>

          <p>

            The entire database is a single file on disk. This is what we're using in this course!
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <li><strong>Strengths:</strong> Zero configuration, portable, perfect for mobile apps and prototyping, completely free (public domain)</li>
            <li><strong>Weaknesses:</strong> Not designed for high concurrency or multi-user access, file-level locking, limited advanced features</li>

          <Callout type="success" title="Why SQLite for this course?">
            SQLite runs entirely in your browser via WebAssembly, making it perfect for learning 
            without any server setup. It's the same SQL syntax you'll use in production databases!

              <strong>Scalability Requirements:</strong> What's the anticipated user load and data volume?

            <li>
              <strong>Consistency Needs:</strong> Is strict ACID compliance non-negotiable?

            <li>
              <strong>Workload Pattern:</strong> Read-heavy, write-heavy, or balanced?

            <li>
              <strong>Operational Overhead:</strong> Team expertise? Dedicated operations team?

              <strong>Ecosystem & Features:</strong> Need specific features like geospatial queries, full-text search?
